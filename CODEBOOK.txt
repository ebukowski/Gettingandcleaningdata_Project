The analysis creates a data set including the mean of each selected observation by subject and activity.
The selected observations are the mean and standard deviation of each feature.

1. Subject: numeric
An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

2. Activity: type of activity performed, with the following values:
      WALKING
      WALKING_UPSTAIRS
      WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
      SITTING
      STANDING
      LAYING
      
3. Rest of columns: experiment data means, where:

time: time in seconds (for all time based data)
freq/Freq: frequency in Hz (for all frequency based data)

mean: mean
std: standard deviation
Acc: accelerometer
Gyro: gyroscope
Jerk: jerk signals
Mag: magnitude

The data set has the following columns:
